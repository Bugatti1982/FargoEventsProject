What is this program? How did it get made?
------------------------------------------

This is a program that I created for a company as a part of my internship.
Ths program is a mobile Android application that I built completely from scratch.
I had no prior knowledge of how to create one before this program. 
I spend roughly 3-4 months to develop this program and had to rely a lot on the Android Studio documentation to help me understand how an Android application works.
I also looked up step-by-step tutorials on Youtube since those tend to be the most helpful to me.
This program also was my first program to implement REST API's since I didn't have any previous knowledge of API's at all.
However, I did have familiarity with the Java language at the time so that made the process go by a little quicker.

How does it work?
-----------------

The program basically has 2 pages when launched: 1 for the login page and 1 page for the list of events pulled by the API's.
When you first launch the program, it should direct you to the login page first.
Thankfully, there is no verification so you can type anything in the USERNAME and PASSWORD fields.
The program should then redirect you to the events page where you will find a list of various articles that are pulled from an API that I was provided.

***DISCLAIMER*** I do not own the rights to the API's provided.
These API's are what the company provided me.
Please be curtious and do not in any way manipulate, copy, or take advantage of these API's since I do not own them.

What are the requirements? How do I run it?
-------------------------------------------

In order to run the program, you will first need a compiler to piece together the code.
The only compiler that can run this type of code is Android Studio Canary (not the standard Android Studio).
Once you download the zip file and extract Andriod Studio Canary, be sure to select a virtual Android machine in order to properly run the program.
I personally recommend using the Pixel 3 XL API 26 machine when running the program.
Next, download my project as a zip file, load up Android Studio Canary, and open as a new project.
